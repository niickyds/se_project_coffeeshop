# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I think adding a button at the bottom that sends you back up to the top would be a good
idea. Or maybe pinning the nav menu to the top of the screen.

Custom themed cursor would be cool.
